<h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Advice Information and Guidance Project</h2>


<p>
    This project offers a comprehensive Information, Advice, and Guidance (IAG) service five days a week at 71 Caledonian Road, London. Accredited by the Advice Quality Standard, our team of qualified advisers provides free, independent, impartial, and confidential support. We assist with a wide range of issues, including welfare benefits, cost-of-living challenges, housing, income maximisation, and connecting individuals to local food banks and crisis services. Our goal is to support disadvantaged individuals facing barriers due to lack of knowledge or skills, ensuring they access the services and entitlements they deserve. IBA delivers expert advice on benefits, housing, consumer matters, and offers translation services to bridge language gaps. We also advocate for our clients, empowering them to assert their rights. Last year, we helped 998 families and individuals, addressing 2,463 inquiries and securing Â£390K in financial benefits for the community.
